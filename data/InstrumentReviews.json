For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.

In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit.

This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Here's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.I didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Unbiased review", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}

I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.

I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.

I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for vocals only!", "unixReviewTime": 1147737600, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2006"}

One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. As a frame of reference, theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic, theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Takes A Licking And Keeps On Ticking", "unixReviewTime": 1229126400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2008"}

I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4\" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\"  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.

I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.As for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells \"it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This gets 5 stars for value but doesn't use my favorite XLR end", "unixReviewTime": 1272326400, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2010"}

The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny.

In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.\"Built like a tank\" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem.

My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.My remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34;real&#34; Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.The guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a &#34;full-sized&#34; guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "My mistake for buying sight unseen.", "unixReviewTime": 1392854400, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2014"}

I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my \"gloating\" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.

My problem with LP's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, I've bought and sold quite a few. Another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didn't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what's not broken. Yup, I said \"on my personal guitars\" because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy, it's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. I've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument.

I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.If I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model.

Andrews \"Permanent tourist\"", "helpful": [18, 19], "reviewText": "If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really couldn't find anything \"wrong\"  with it.  Yes, it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls, such as having only two controls for volume and tone, rather than four, which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson.  But you weren't planning to try to fool anyone, were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique, rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good, and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine.  The pickups are surprisingly good.  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls.  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good, although it would sure be nice if they didn't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish, reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying.  For several reasons, if I had this to do over, I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC).  Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change.  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is, I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup.  It had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately.  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as I'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners.  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box, I was a little unsure of my purchase.  However, now that it's been fully set up  and new strings installed, I am quite pleased with this guitar.  I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric.  I was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, I'll want to upgrade anyway.  Now I'm glad I chose this one.  For one thing, this is a guitar I'll always enjoy having around.  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it.  In 2-3 years, my tastes may change.  I may want something completely different down the road, and now I still have that option.  Had I gone with a more expensive model, I'd feel locked in.  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar.  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one.  Have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice guitar and a great value", "unixReviewTime": 1334793600, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2012"}

But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4\" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesn't need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar.

I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums.

I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed.

I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed \"off\"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer.

Despite being an \"authorized retailer\" for Planet Waves, AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. I've emailed Planet Waves, but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I don't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home, so unless the manufacturer comes through, this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.I frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. I've used cables with the G&H; quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H-; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than I'm used to, which makes coiling for storage very easy, but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined.

Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.

Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds \"noise\" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, \"neutered\" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be \"expensive\" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a \"budget\" or \"entry level\" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.

There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless \"boutique\" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to \"stock\" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, I don't need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I haven't owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it's \"old school\" rock distortion. The usual \"may not appeal to metalheads\" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap \"boutique\" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I'd considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.

Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.

It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.

It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.

This is your deal.\"I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Wish I knew then what I know now...", "unixReviewTime": 1309392000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2011"}

Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.

The enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable.  Not true bypass, but none of the BOSS pedals are.  It doesn't suck tone.  This pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals don't. You lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with EL84s.  As a stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals.  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  You get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  Lately, I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo).  As with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp.  That's just not what it was intended to do. It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV.

Like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  It's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer, except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a \"rock\" overdrive, while the TS-9 is more of a \"tube/blues\" effect.  There's probably some truth to that, but both of them are excellent pedals.However, the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isn't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a \"booster\" pushing an already overdrive amp, or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone, and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that aren't fair.  You hear things like \"it cuts out too much bass\", when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And, like I said before, I feel as if it's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it's a Boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles.  If you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound \"big\", there are probably better options in this range.

Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo. If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.The Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: \"Rate\" of modulation, \"Depth\" of modulation (how much does the volume vary), and a \"Wave\" shape (jagged, square, or somewhere on a continuum in between). Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own (CE-5 & PH-3), the TR-2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like you're \"playing in a fishbowl\" (as another reviewer puts it).The \"Wave\" control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility, so it is a nice feature to have. Most tremolos have it, but not all. For the price, it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy. It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on \"Guerilla Radio,\" and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths \"How Soon Is Now?\" I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest, and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.Like all Boss stuff, the box is sturdy and I like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units.

This wah pedal just doesn't cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn't been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!The eq on this pedal isn't good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.My suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.If you want a cheap child's gimic-type toy, this is for you.

The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.

Hawkins \"HumanJHawkins\"", "helpful": [7, 9], "reviewText": "I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointing Quality and Engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1306886400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2011"}

I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A!

Some people pay for silver and expect gold ;)Okay, so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful \"pop\" sounds that this is supposed to filter \"hard P, hard T, hard B, S, and a few others.\" So I got this. Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The \"pop\" sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all, just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball, it looks like a professional product. It doesn't really matter since I work from home and not in a public place, but it's nice to know I can show it to people and it \"looks nice\"3. The clamp, bendable arm, and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to, say, a desk probably won't be a stable as attached to a round thing, like the stem to a mic.4. I don't know why people think this \"isn't sturdy\"...I mean you're not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that it's 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.Cons1. It's pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I can't do that anymore with this pop filter on it.

Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.Compared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.And yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.

High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. He's not a big kid, so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously. For example, I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Don't let the size fool you. I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldn't have been more wrong.  There are several big websites and it's tough to find any negatives about this amp. Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "For the price - an easy 5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1308096000, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2011"}

A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy.

This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer, but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family, this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus, flanger, phaser, or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.

If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So, here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier.Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either. All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod. While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isn't much about it that would give away its price. No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt you'll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This will more than suffice", "unixReviewTime": 1376006400, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2013"}

The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far. The strings it came with weren't complete crap, but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings. The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant.It's quite comfortable to play, I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away. I'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E' on it, so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking. I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag. GET IT!Also; I'm buying a hard case to take it home, or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection.

You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.

A/B these with some $5.00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work. I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each. These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had. It seems my speakers were \"audio coupling\" with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies.My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ. Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate. I didn't hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers. I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range. The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion. Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end, I love these speakers. Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers. He said he loved them. I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on. WOW!! What a difference. It was an immediate difference. The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there. I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix. I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers. Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately. These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem. \"Cheap foam\"??

The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium.The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a \"bend\" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them.

Why? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack.  The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give, or slackens when attacking hard. With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility.I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid '80's.I like the Dunlops feel, grip, and durability.

Most picks have high ratings, because players who like that particular type, write reviews that rate them highly.  Obviously, the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar, but that isn't always possible.  With that said, for what they are worth, here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop's purple colored, Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like a pick with a sharp point for better control, and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the pick's rounded edges, help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings, which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar, I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic, and semi-solid body guitars, where the string tension is greater.I had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously, but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker, and heavier, and has absolutely no \"give\" at all.  I'm still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers, when picking rapidly, I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry, does help.My favorite pick had been theDunlop 0.6mm nylon pick, but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily, and be more precise, while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell, but this may become my new favorite pick.The \"pick pack\" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you're a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "this pick helped to improve the precision of my playing...", "unixReviewTime": 1377302400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2013"}

(I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works Fine & Much Better Than Nothing!", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}

It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.

I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did.

It's solid as a rock with chrome handles, edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control.It looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review, the AC adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally.  It also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer.  Now I can take the Fender or Gibson electrics rather than the acoustic.Okay, I keep getting off topic here...The sound is clear and crisp for it's size.  Sure, it's not my Fender Mustang IV, but I didn't pay 600 bucks for it either.  But then my Fender doesn't have a pig's snout!!  There are no controls on this for tone adjustments, just a volume knob.  But, most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway.  I would compare the sound coming from it as above average but it's the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction, for me anyway.As for it's size, I would say it's just about the size of your average small jewelry box.  But it's much heavier, deceptively heavy but I like that.  It doesn't have that &#34;cheap&#34; feel about it.Like I said, I WILL use this occasionally, especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van.  I look forward to the comments the amp will get, I'm sure way more than my guitar playing skills as I still have a lot to learn.  But, learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun.In summary, I would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone who's looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an AC adapter.A word to best describe it....&#34;COOL&#34;.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WAY better, louder and clearer than I ever expected  AND IT IS SO CUTE!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}

Stick an SM-57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking it's a tube amp. By working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound, along with that \"barely breaking up\" holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players.By learning how much you can do with relatively little, you'll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone-shaping tools that have come along since.It might surprise those who take today's hyper-saturated, over-processed metal distortion for granted as the official, community-sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain.One bit of weirdness: When I began playing my Pignose I immediately noticed a buzz, as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill. The four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and, sure enough, an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly. Fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage.Get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice.The first amp I ever had was a small Ampeg tube from the early 60's with a single 6 inch speaker, volume and tone knobs. I've no idea how many watts it put out - not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door. With that baby cranked, I spent many happy hours in tone heaven. All these years (and amps) later I guess I've always been searching for that sound and the Pignose comes closer than any tube distortion, blues overdrive pedal or rat-ty box I've tried.For the money, you can't beat it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Thoreau Would Love It", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}

As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be.  Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume, it changes its distortion (the louder, the more distorted).  The Pignose power supply (Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100) is helpful when been home, but also works with 6 AA batteries.  You can also amplify it's sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp.  It comes with really nice looking stickers.  I'm planning to keep it for years.Update on review(Jan 9, 2013).I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps, but as time goes by, I just fall more in love with my Piggy!  I've learned to use better it's own volume combined with the guitar's.I have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose, but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives; I cannot get this crunch with the other amps, no matter how much pedals, bells, whistles I have tried... This crunch is unique and the world loves it, as simple and plain as that.  The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love with.The 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble (the one that make teenage girls sigh for you...) with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Muddy Pig", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

It's not very good for vocals, it's inefficient, what with its 40-year old design, and it distorts way too easy. There are far better amps for most purposes from Boss and others that deliver a lot more clean volume, thanks to modern class-D amp technology, and a variety of digital effects to boot.BUT... there is one area where the Pig prevails. If you're looking for the sound of a big overdriven amp in the studio, or miked on stage, the Pignose will give you that sound for less than the cost of one good quality overdrive pedal. By opening and closing the box, you can get a range of cabinet sounds from the open-back Fender to the classic Marchall sealed cab, and everything in between. Frank Zappa recorded a lot of his guitar parts using nothing but his SG running into a Pignose, and he got fantastic sounds.Beyond that, it's cool looking, reasonably rugged, and even has pegs that allow you to hang it from a guitar strap.

It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches.As for using pedals with it, it will take distortion to a degree. It reaches a point, if pushed too hard, at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill. You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect, especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer. I don't think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey, for example, though, which has more dirt in the tones it produces. I don't have a fuzz box (not yet, but have one on order), but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner, sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz. Otherwise, you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound.My wah wah, a Morley Power Wah, was almost useless with it. The limited frequency response of the 5\" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again.A chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it, but a phaser, in my case, a Phase 90, just destroys the sound. A flanger is also not really advisable. You can use delay, just not with very rapid repeats. Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose' speaker. I just bought a Dynacomp, but haven't tried it on the piggy.This is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business. Once the young 'un seems dedicated, though, it is time to think about moving up to a VOX AC15C1 (note: that amp can do hard rock fine, but not high gain metal) or an ENGL Screamer.

Adjusting it is a tad tedious, but, you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes.I've mounted my Samson Q1U Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone to it.

Make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension, or it will tip over if there's too much weight.

But sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks!Case in point: pure nickel strings. Time was when that was all there was...and gee whiz, that was a time when good guitar tone ruled. Coincidence? Nope. These things just sound better, if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds. If you're used to wrapped strings, and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal, these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general. Especially if you use tubes.Tubes and pure nickel are like Gilmour and Strats or Angus and SGs. They just fit.I'm not nuts about Fender acoustic strings, but I like their normal electric strings fine, though Ernie Ball Slinkies have been my go-tos for many years. But these Fender pure nickels are very very nice, and at 4.75, they're a real deal. Most pure nickels run nearer to ten, and these sound pretty much the same, and I don't seem to break many of 'em neither. If you're used to mixed alloy, pure nickels might seem a little \"dull\", but wait a bit and you'll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded. Plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips. Try a set and see what I mean. It's subtle but it's beautiful.But the main reason I love these is for playing at VOLUME! I turned my modded Hot Rod Deluxe up to call-the-cops levels (the neighbors are getting used to it by now), louder than the drummer by a good chunk, and I got: less squealing, warmer tone by far, and full chords, triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string I've ever used. I think there's an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime. Check out BB's tone on the legendary Live At The Regal to hear what I mean. That's the stuff.So, if you haven't tried pure nickels, spend a buck or two more (or maybe less!) than you normally do and give these bargain-priced nickels a try. You might find that you're a convert within seconds. I know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up; those Zep and Jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel. And digging into some Otis Rush or Billy Gibbons licks is like night and day.

I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fender Strings", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}

Amazing!They are not coated, but after a while I got used to that, and now actually prefer non-coated strings.These really do bring out the \"earthy\" tones of my dreadnought.

Well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open - guess I'm used to side cutters or pliers - and it doesn't cut strings really close to the tuning pin - it leaves about a half inch of string hanging. Oh, if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar (go to the Elixir Strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the Taylor guitar factory) your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners. The alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more.I find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings, somebody could manage to break this plastic tool. The tool is made of sturdy plastic. If abused, trying to cut copper wire, it might break; but the tool was never designed for that use.I've used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time. I use this on three different guitars, an acoustic and two electrics (Les Paul and PRS). The pin puller works just fine, I actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood.

At first I was skeptical because it's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp. I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings. I'm happy to say that it does an excellent job, much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using.  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly.  It's nice not having to carry the pliers around, which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock. As for the bridge pin puller, I tried it once but it is rather ineffective. I think it was included more as an afterthought as it's just a notched edge and can't really pull stuck pins. For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter.

And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing.

So it costs less because we don't need to use it as much!But then I remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought, okay... shouldn't they have a $5.99 one for 5-string bass guitars?Sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when I realized with some dismay that there are even 6-string bass guitars.  Will this even work on a 6-string bass?  After all, that's 2 more strings than its intended purpose!These perplexing questions aside, I find this to be an excellent and ideal tool.  Its function is three-fold:1) String winder2) String cutter3) Peg pullerSo no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string.  All the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably-priced tool.  Made by D'addario, the quality lives up to the brand.  It's solid, the wire cutter and peg puller well designed.  It does everything it's supposed to do, does it well and is of good construction.PROS:  Good strong well-designed unitCONS: The winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use.  I would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening. Because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5.I note that there are reviews here as old as four years... and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time.  Some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head.  Others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys.What I believe is that it is a mistake to sell the BASS and STANDARD GUITAR version on the same page.  From what I can deduce from the reviews, it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the BASS guitar version, which does indeed have a wide and deep cup, and did not realize it.  Imho, the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity.  It's obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit.Some have reported the peg puller being \"metal\" and scratching the bridge.  The one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isn't careful-- the same holds true for needle nose pliers.Bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they're doing, don't get in a rush, and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using ANY modification tool. I suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings 0 to 60 in 5 seconds... they may wind up damaging their guitar.  Turn on the light, put on reading glasses if necessary to see... and take your time and this device should work fine.  Be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date (dunno why the company didn't simply start a new listing when redesigning the device).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "So many questions, so many questions...", "unixReviewTime": 1385337600, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2013"}

I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar. Every time I got the higher strings in tune, the lowers would go down as much as a half note. It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings. So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws. I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress. The final time I tightened them down, the high E string broke. Since these were my only beefy's, my day was done with these strings. However, given how far I tightened the tension screws, I think I would have had to purchase an additional tension spring (not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge flush with the body.As I said, this isn't a knock of these strings.

I've come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it.  Eventually, all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs, you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn't make any sense.  If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them, even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost.Few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the U.S. and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names.  Granted Elixir probably isn't one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price?  I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way.  In fact, you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings; at least most people would be able to hear the difference.  Don't get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique (practice), getting better cables, pickups, amps, guitars etc than from just using these strings.  For better string life, just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use.

From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have \"old standbys\" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect.If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.

I typically practice sitting down without a strap when I am alone, but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band. I had previously used a very expensive 2\" padded leather cradle type strap, which I really liked. I sold that banjo and the strap with it, but recently re-acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap, but was not willing to pay the $80 again for a premium padded leather strap. I saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance. I am glad I did.This strap may not be as elegant as fine leather, but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction. What blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo, which weighs about 14 pounds, literally felt half as heavy. It is no joke. At first, the feeling was unnerving, because the strap has some elastic give to it. You get this dual sensation of a) the banjo feeling super light and b) as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor. Paradoxical I know, but that's where the magic of this strap is. It is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you, but in reality it remains very stable when playing.Like I said, the build quality is outstanding. My only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non-traditional, so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument, like a 5-string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap.This is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point.

Last year I switched to D'Addario EXP16's because they sounded better on the guitar I have now, but still keep a pack of Nanowebs as a backup.  Here are my pros and cons of this string:Pros:+Easier to fret and play than other strings.  I don't know why; I looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings.  But they certainly are easier to fret (press down) and play than any other string I've tried, including other coated ones.  The coating on the Nanoweb strings is thinner than the Elixir Polyweb series, but still feel very smooth and even 'slippery', as some people remarked.  They have very little string squeak.+Last longer than any other strings I've tried - maybe because of their brightness, these strings mellow with age (as all strings do) but never really sound dull.  The only reason I saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke, usually every few months of regular playing.+Very bright sound, which cuts through well playing live with a full band, and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars.  However, this can also be a con (see below)Cons:-Cost more than most strings, including other coated strings.-Can sound overly bright, especially on some higher end guitars.  They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar, which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction, but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well.  For this reason I switched to the EXP16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar. The EXP16 is coated but has a more natural/dark sound that complements the 'woodiness' of the guitar better than the Elixirs (although not as easy to play).-Not available for export outside the U.S.  When I was working abroad, I used to buy these from a U.S. company who would ship them to me.

I would happily bail on Elixir at $13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well. In fact, I was quite optimistic about the $9 D'Addario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string. Nothing that I've used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple box.The sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected. That's not where Elixirs kill the competition though. It's after 20 hours of play that they show their strength. You will still hear fresh, bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone. In fact, I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull. I play relatively aggressively and use palm-muting constantly, allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridge.Saying that the tone lasts 3.5x longer (as stated on the box) might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternatives.If you are an occasional player or a music shop owner, these are a no-brainer. The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure. For the everyday, aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life.One nit-picky point of criticism: the packaging is an issue for me. WHY would any manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale? I'm seriously asking! I've got to be missing something here. A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener, more cost-efficient, and it keeps the strings fresh (thank YOU D'Addario, I'll never leave your electric strings). I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf-life.

They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone.

The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers.

I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a \"bad set\", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all.]", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not very impressed so far", "unixReviewTime": 1347235200, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2012"}

Although I don't play gigs on it, I play the guitar just about every day, or maybe every other day.  The custom lights are wonderful:  great durability, nice tone and projection, easy on the fingers.  I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 3/4 size travel guitar I have.  The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings, thereby putting less stress on the body.  Compared with the light D'Addario strings that came with the guitar, these have a more muffled low E string.  The A string, too, doesn't project as much as the standard strings.  Although I've not tried the extra lights on my full-sized acoustic, I suspect that there, too, the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands.  Even with the custom light set--where the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light set--the bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality.  The thing that most players of Elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability.  They are smoother feeling than non-coated strings, and certainly don't degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings.  The other thing that's important to know, though, is that the Elixirs are excellent at holding a tune, once they're stretched and broken in.  That being said, I'm not sure that I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the bass projection issue:  a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings don't help.  As you might have guessed, though, I'm thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the full-sized acoustic.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Long Lasting, Easy on the Fingers", "unixReviewTime": 1256774400, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2009"}

For one, the guitar doesn't have a \"finish,\" not even a glossy clearcoat -- it's solidbody wood, sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain. Secondly, the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is.

Sure, there are plenty of other options out there, but I just had it in my head thats what I wanted. Well, I must say I am very happy with the purchase. Guitar arrived in its triangular shelf box, inside another Dean shipping box, which was wrapped in bubble sheet packed inside yet another, larger, Amazon box. Was essentially ready to play right out of the box, with a few quick turns of the tuning pegs. One knock on it I have seen online before buying was that the tuners don't hold tight, I have not yet had this problem after a week of playing it, including some drastic bends. Checked with a steel straightedge and a light, the neck was dead flat and straight. The edges of the frets could use some more finishing, they are still a bit edgy. I have seen others mention filing them down a bit, same thing that would be done on a more expensive guitar at the factory. I will probably get some diamond files and do this as well, I keep hanging up my hand on them on the bottom of the neck. I'm no expert on tone, but this has a nice even sound and responds well to pretty much any pedals or effects I've thrown at it. I did restring mine with the DR Neon Multi-Color strings for using with Rocksmith, which required adjusting the intonation. The low E and A strings ended up at the very end of their range, and the A is actually still a tiny bit flat. This could well be a factor of those particular strings though, so I wont knock the guitar for it. As others have noted, the finish can vary drastically. Mine is much darker than the stock photo and the grain is much less noticeable. Overall, looks a nice piece, especially for the cost. I could not ask for better for this price.

Maybe not a perfect tool but I believe it does what it is supposed to and does it well.Keeping in mind, I'm a guitar player who just bought a drum kit... My assumptions when using this are that drum tuning is &#34;relative&#34; meaning that 99% of drum pitch is established by ear, based on what you want each drum to sound like, unlike a stringed instrument which is tuned against an absolute reference frequency and each string has a distinct relation to the others.The concept with this torque key is that it assists you with applying equal tension on each of the tension rods therefore presumably having an equal tune all the way around the circumference of the head. It by no means will help you establish as specific pitch on any drum; it simply helps you achieve an even tension and &#8220;relative&#8221; pitch all around the head. The tension numbers on the torque key are for reference only, 2 is tighter than 1, 3 is tighter than 2... and so on. Yet these numbers are only relevant to each head; I find that you don't necessarily pick a number such as 2 and tune all the drums to that.The way I use this, right or wrong, is that I tune an approximate tune on any given head using the traditional method of tapping around the perimeter and tightening apposing rods as necessary until the pitch is the same all the way around and at an audible frequency that I like for the drum I&#8217;m tuning. Now theoretically you&#8217;re pretty well tuned anyway but this is when I grab my torque key and I set it to a number a bit lower than were I expect the torque is (this only comes from experience of using it a few times) then I check a tension rod and I increase the setting on the torque key until it no longer &#34;breaks over&#34;. Now, whatever number I'm on is the reference number for that drum. My process from here is to move around the head in the same crisscross pattern as you would tuning traditionally but I loosen each rod a bit first and then bring it back up to torque with the torque key. After this process, my drum head should both be at a pitch that I have chosen by ear and have equal pitch all around the drum head.I believe it is a common practice to use a slightly different tension on the bottom side head ether a little tighter or looser than the top side (typically a little lower pitch on the bottom?). Once you&#8217;ve tuned the top head, and you know what number you&#8217;ve used you can quickly tune the bottom by reducing or increasing a click or two on your torque key.Sure there are a few other variable that can come in to play like, did you seat the head adequately when installing it which in essence means did you apply some light pressure to the center of the head while drawing down the tension rods in small equal amounts in a crisscross pattern. Also, how are the rims of your shells, are they well machined and smooth? These may impact the ability for a torque based tune to work. How about your tension rods, are the threads clean, are they lubricated? Any variability in resistance of the threads on your torque rods will directly translate to pitch in that location. Again, I'm just a rookie and I may be off with some of these assumptions or they may have an essentially unmeasurable impact so take it for what it's worth.Once you find a tuning you like, you could write down what number it took to achieve the pitch you like on each head, that would make it easy to quickly get back to the same pitch if/when your drums need to be tuned again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I believe it does what it is supposed to, granted I'm a rookie drummer", "unixReviewTime": 1397088000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2014"}

When it arrived the instructions were not clear, but I sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning. Too loose and deep, so I increased the setting to #3 and repeated.  Almost the sound I wanted, so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern.  Perfect.  I then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest.  Using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 1/2 octave apart.Next I worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side. I used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound I wanted. The bass drum came next - I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning. From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attained.This is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two. When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting.  Test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want. Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set.I'll never go back to tuning by ear!

I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.

Well i bought all my picks from the music store so im rating the picks only. Ive been playing a few years and own a takamine acoustic and a fender strat. I mostly play my acoustic and use light strings so i dont need a heavy pick. I started using med fender tortose shell celluloid picks and really liked the look but as a beginner i dropped them more. My friend left a thin pick and i tried it. Since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice. The pick had a little more give so i dropped them less. Ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it. I started reading all these great reviews how the dunlop tortex was great so i ran down an bought some thins. The tip is a little more rounded. I tried them and they feel alright but the fenders were louder and brighter sounding no doubt about it. So its back to the fenders. Also something i learned is when i play a guitar that has a dark pickguard i use a light colored pick (pearloid) and a red pick for a white pickguard. The contrast helps you see what your doing. These are good picks and you have a good selection of colors instead of the dunlop that are color coded and your stuck with no choice. These are a little more slippery but you will get used to them the more you play. I dont drop em anymore. Personally i dont see any need for a heavy pick unless you play bass.

Lebryk", "helpful": [25, 25], "reviewText": "The biggest question I ask about these cables, are they worth the premium charged above more normal cables? The key to me is the lower end 100 series Monster cables,Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable (12 Feet). The answer is mixed, and depends on what you are looking for.The cable ends are very heavy, they are metal and do unscrew. In some ways this is probably good, they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging. The jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime. On the other hand, the series 100 plugs are a molded plastic end, with a good bit of flex to them, and they are lighter weight. So the choice is, heavy, shiny gold; or light weight, gray/black? For me, I like the heft of these cables.Construction-wise these are likely lifetime cables. Check out the pictures I've posted. The metal housing screws into the jack. There is an O-ring to seal the top portion of the threads. Inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack, and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic. Unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war, the wire is never separating from the jack. I don't think the actual 1/4 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks.Sound is excellent. They are clear clean cables. Are they better than the 100's? Oh maybe a tiny bit. Maybe a little clearer, cleaner sound. But it isn't a huge difference.Bottom line, for gigging, probably go with the 100's. The jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace. For practice or in your house, these are probably the way to go. They do look particularly good plugged into a Marshall half stack.These cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else Monster Cable. Study different one quarter inch jack cables and you'll see these are priced very close to everyone else.

{"reviewerID": "ACWH4WJMC5UFN", "asin": "B0002E382Q", "reviewerName": "H. S. Ryu \"Paul\"", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "These cables work very well at transmitting sound. So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack).

Lebryk", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar. D'Addario has finally made a string that is comparable to and maybe a little tiny bit better than the Elixir's.These are very nice bright strings. The coating is incredibly subtle, almost impossible to feel on the strings. I like that. Compared to Elixir's these are a bit brighter, with good feel.Call me old school, I hate the packaging. These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag. Ah, you know I'm just so used to strings that are individually looped. Two strings looped together makes a mess while I'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair, I've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench. The neat freak in me hates that. I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag. Yeah I get it; they are trying to be more environmentally responsible. But darn it, 6 paper envelopes? It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials, not some environmental cause. 100% post-consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load.I know D'Addario loves the color coded ends. On my acoustic guitar that's irrelevant, the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs. On my electric guitars, I don't like the look at all. I prefer gold or silver rings at the end. If the strings are in individual labeled packages, there's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much, they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging. I have yet to decode their colors or naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar. I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them. The slightly thicker string is not bad.Oddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixir's. My reason for using the original D'Addario strings is low price - if somebody is doing gigs nightly, those uncoated strings are the only way to go. Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician. For the home enthusiast, coated strings make a ton of sense, they do last longer. I think they are worth the premium price. Now there are two choices for excellent coated strings.In the end, the packaging, the color coded end rings, the crazy package coding, and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar. What they sound like and play like is the most important thing.

The high E and B are 3 mm less and I can feel it but not enough to bother me. All things being equal I prefer heavier strings for tone but I play instruments I don't trust with truly heavy gauges.The first thing I noticed is considerably less \"new string clang\" compared to both the Martins and D'Addario's regular phosphur bronze strings which I've used in the past and still use for mandolin.While still a long way from sounding broken-in, the EXP strings sound as though they've had several days of good use. As a kid I perspired much more and would just rot strings like you wouldn't believe - on a humid summer day I could get rid of that clang in a hour.The tension on the EXP's feels very comfortable and considerably more flexible than the 7 mm difference should account for. I like to bend strings on acoustic in certain contexts, which can be tough with tight strings; the EXP's feel very easy - not electric guitar easy mind you, but fine for acoustic.The other quality that's noticeable is sustain. The strings I took off weren't completely dead and I wasn't expecting a dramatic difference, but it's noticable across the board, especially on small chord comping on three or four strings at a time.The tone also feels a bit more balanced across all six strings, but this is admittedly very subjective: I play with differently shaped and thicknessed picks for different recording contexts; some generate more percussive pick noise than others; sometimes I want it, other times no. The response of the EXPs sounds very consistent to my ears.I've had them on for a couple of weeks now, playing fairly regularly. Some of the initial clang is gone but the (desired) bright lively tone has not degraded noticeably.I suppose the real test of the EXP coating is how they sound beyond the point where other strings begin to sound dead.

If you leave them on long enough, the steel cores and bronze windings will actually corrode- but that takes months, if not more. Before that happens, grease from your fingers, dust, bits of skin, and other detritus from the environment gets into the strings, between the windings. This interferes with the free vibration of the strings and deadens the sound. Back when strings were a lot more expensive, some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them; some bass players still do. Coated strings are a simpler alternative.These strings and similar ones like Elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings, which accomplishes two things: First, it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap, which prevents rust and corrosion. Second, it provides a physical barrier that prevents contamination from getting in between the windings. The strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings. They do sound just a bit less bright than the equivalent uncoated strings, but it's not a huge difference, and after a month or two they still sound the same.They also cost about twice as much as equivalent non-coated D'Addarios. Are they worth it? That depends. If you're an active performer, maybe. You're probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you're getting a bright sound. You're probably also buying your strings by the box. There's no real benefit to these strings. Where they really pay off is for the casual player who may not have a few dozen spare sets handy. These days I'm strictly a hobbyist who might play publicly once or twice a year. I have four acoustic guitars, and some of them may go go for a month or more without being played. With coated strings, I can leave a set on a guitar, and a month or two later I can pull it out of the case and it's ready to play. I still change strings if I'm going to be playing in public, but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house, these are great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A little pricey- but worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1359072000, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013"}

I also use aHeil PR-40 Dynamic Studio Recording Microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item. Both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm, natural feel.One thing, well actually two things, the Shure SM7B has that the Heil PR40 does not is a set of two switches.  One for bass rolloff and one for mid-range emphasis / presence boost.  While both of these switches can be useful, I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments that need to be done.  If you don't have outboard processing, both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises (for example, someone bumping the table) to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better.When I reviewed the Heil PR-40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit.  While the PR40 is about $70.00 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR-40 users will want to use a shockmount (about $100) and pop filter / windscreen ($15 - $60) to get the best results out of the microphone.  With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens (one for normal use and one for ultra-close up use) with the microphone.  So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the Heil.Another thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR-40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank.  It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand.  Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off-axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications.The SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR-40, so you'll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer / pre-amp that can handle the microphone.The bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it.

{"reviewerID": "A2KI91IR3RA7D0", "asin": "B0002E4Z8M", "reviewerName": "David L. Vasser", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had.  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5.Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work.  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40.  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available.  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available.  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B.  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc.  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5.  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages.  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B.Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production.  Stop looking and buy one.  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word.  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's.  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact.Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't.DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B.  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool.  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options.  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that.The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give.  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work.  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is \"THE VOICE\" microphone and that was all it was intended to be. It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone.Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably.  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice.  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise.  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else.  With the SM7B you don't have to.Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves \"Recording Engineers\" today are usually totally ignorant about.  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong.If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it.  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is.  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it.  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers.  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it. I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too.  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59.  70 dB would be better. Lots is made of the \"LOW OUTPUT\" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54.5 dB! -4.5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp.  But again most of the \"one-box-solution\" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind.The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments.  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra.  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens.  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel.  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case.  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them. The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add.  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged.  They are also very durable for foam screens.On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best. You can just leave the plate off if you want. This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic.So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work.  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one.  I still am an SM7B guy.  I would give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Vocal Dynamic Microphone Still In Production!", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "A1QDSJZQWJZOL1", "asin": "B0002E4Z8M", "reviewerName": "T. Cox", "helpful": [38, 38], "reviewText": "What you need to know about this mic:1) This mic is very directional. You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results. Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect. I found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best. As long as I keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room I'm in. Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose. Aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal. Right at the upper lip works well for me.2) The bass cut and presence boost are convenient. Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it. I've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best. Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids. Flat's where it's at. Flat sounds most natural.3) Being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might. Though it takes EQ well, and you can EQ that in. If you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while I realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you. After using it for a few years, I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem. Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either.4) Yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so. It rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive. So if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up. So don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one. Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set. Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix.5) So what does it sound like? The sound is *very* natural and true to my voice. It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost. That plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points. It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds. It does have slight color in the mids; I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900Hz, slight boost 1000-2000Hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that. The color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range. That's one reason why this mic is considered \"flattering\" on vocals. It still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic.6) This thing is heavy and rugged. The capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides. The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors. What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do. So it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts. Even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down.7) This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing, 55-60dB for quiet singing, 65-70dB for whispering. Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain. Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB. If your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a CloudLifter and it'll add 25dB of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too.Overall, I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one. But since my room isn't perfect, this will do. The biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix. It's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B. Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results.EDIT 2014:  Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser. This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches. So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color. In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser. It really does. Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as I said below you can *easily* EQ that in, since this mic takes EQ very well. Seriously, a 2dB shelf in the highs. Another thing I wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can EQ that down a bit. And finally, when Shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it. Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Natural sounding, but positioning is everything", "unixReviewTime": 1313020800, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2011"}

A Strat cannot be made to sound like a Les Paul and vice versa.  Your tone is made up of many, many variables.  The resulting tone can be SHAPED or COLORED by adding or subtracting certain frequencies.  That is the function of an EQ, nothing more.  IT can range from dramatic to very subtle.

That's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $100 TS-9 Tubescreamer.In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to.  This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone.  Notes will sing and chords will really crunch, especially in blues and classic rock.  But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ.  Virtually any distortion pedal has a \"Tone\" control that will make the tone darker or brighter.  But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble (or vice versa), you may not find the sound you want.  That's what's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak, you can fatten it up.  If it's too muddy, you can add treble.  And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal, and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal.  The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal, but I find that easier to use.If you're a beginning player or a player on a budget, this would be an outstanding pedal to own, along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal.  There's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer, if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear.

What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious, bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price (it currently sells for $49.95 here at Amazon).

While I now prefer the latest Direct Sound EX-29s (a vast improvement over my original DS cans, mentioned below), the Firth's are still VERY good and, as a bonus, cost half as much. I still use both brands.Please remember to carefully monitor your SLP (volume) level with ANY isolation phones. Without background noise for reference, one can easily play them too loudly which, in turn, can lead to hearing loss over time.UPDATE 4/23/2010: I now own three pairs of Vic Firth isolation headphones and I'm happy to report the original pair is still going strong. Meanwhile, my office setup now consists of two ART Tube MP units...carefully adjusted to add little/no volume to the signal path (unity gain)...as a vacuum tube buffer stage between a Behringer U-Control UCA-202 DAC and a small Behringer Eurorack UB-502 mixer to provide silky-smooth state-of-the-art amplification for the Vic Firth isolation headphones. The resulting sound is absolutely top-drawer and completely belies the incredibly low price....about $150 total...I paid for the entire system. Affordable technology in the service of great art!UPDATE 2/3/2009: These bullet proof headphones have definitely stood the test of time. I now own two pairs of Vic Firth headphones. The newest pair live in my gym bag. Both pairs have survived abuse that would make lesser instruments crumble (e.g. getting tangled in the crank of a spin trainer or knocked onto a cement floor by my cat).BONUS TIP: Because these are full-sized headphones with large ear cups, I frequently use them in conjunction with the new Hearos High Fidelity \"full audio spectrum\" ear plugs (&lt;$15). The combo works in much the same the way Dolby noise reduction does. I play my MP3 player (or other signal source) 12 decibels louder and the ear plugs then attenuate 12 decibels...leaving me with the same music and way less background noise. This stuff may not fit your head/ears as well as it fits mine, but you might try it if you're so inclined.ORIGINAL REVIEW: How does an ADHD adult maintain focus in a busy, high-tech work environment? Soothing music is part of the fix. Active noise canceling headphones? I've tried and replaced several...but they either sound badly, are prone to electrical/mechanical problems, or both. What to do? Vic Firth and Direct Sound have effective and durable answers. Isolation headphones. I own and use them both. The Direct Sound phones block a bit more noise...the Vic Firth are more comfortable for extended wearing. Both have excellent sound quality.

It is just an on/off switch, so no half modeling here,The only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20% of the market who will get home and , if they hadn't thought to check, may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed.  A backward sustain pedal is not fun.  Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse  switch that would eliminate that potential headache.These days, most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly (never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on, you may very well cause an issue you don't expect and are confused by - turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases.)So - build quality, excellent.  Durability - excellent (I've had a bunch of cheaper pedals - used on stage - break  at the switch point or at the jack), this Yamaha endures.  Design - some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure- I don't see that much anymore, but, so long as you aren't on glossy hardwood, this will stay I place with no issue.I've read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard, or something similar,  All a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch, engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit, and disengaged when the pedal is released.  There are no electronics - so - if it doesn't work, there are three points to look at 1) unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all  connected to the metal posts inside the housing. There are usually two wires of differing color.  if one is disconnected, the pedal will cease to function (and, in rare instances, cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely.  This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder - jacks are points of strain so it isn't inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected. 2) The switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged.  The switches in the Yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part, would be unlikely to wear out with normal use. I have, however, needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment.  this was easy and a quick fix, even with limited tools.  The third option is 3) the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse.  This can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity &#34;switch&#34;, if it senses on startup, or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether - doing nothing At all - it is #1 or 2 or a problem with the jack on the keyboard (HIGHLY unlikely,,but I've seen it happen.). Hopefully this helps some who have posted questions.To conclude - a nice pedal for the money, much better build than the m-audio (decent, just not as nice as the Yamaha - certainly not a bad unit)/on stage (if they can't get most of their mic stands right, I don't trust them with even basic electronics...) or generics.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Heavy duty, well constructed single tongue pedal.", "unixReviewTime": 1378080000, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2013"}

I read great reviews here and the price seemed good. It is a slightly darker color than the picture, as others have mentioned. And the top part isn't pink like the pic, also as others have mentioned. It still looks pretty. I did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones (to minimize finger pain) I ordered \"d'addario EJ15-3D phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings, extra light\" in a package of three sets. And I like those strings better. The color is nicer (though the originals weren't rusty, they looked new-- others have said their strings were rusty but mine weren't) but most importantly it's easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter (thinner) strings.I might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part (I am a female and it's already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a man's, especially bar chords), but for now this is fine.I also ordered \"dava 6024 grip tip\" guitar picks, they are nice. And I got a \"kyser 6-string capo\" in gold and that works well. And I got a \"planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system\" add-on for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck. The strap I got was a Levy's with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable. And I got a \"planet waves pro winder\" string winder/cutter which came in handy for re-stringing. And I bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which I haven't tried yet. And I keep the guitar sitting on an \"on stage xcg4\" guitar stand. And I got a string cleaner by fender.So I write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar. I'll be using mine to sing with, so that's why I needed a capo cause many songs I sing need a capo.

Tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well.  Often only a tweak or 2 before a practice session is all that is needed.  I have never had it go out of tune while playing (even when stringbending!)  As you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine.  It is amazingly playable.  From simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all!  The only real compliant I had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the stock strings aren't the best (IMHO) for a beginner.  I'm pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound, and WON'T break, they are BRUTAL on new fingers!  I would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on.  The only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings.  All in all this is a great deal for the beginner- or even advanced players that just want an extra guitar around to jam on when they don't feel like dragging out the expensive units (like playing around a campfire, or outdoors)  If your a beginner just starting out- this is a great route to go as the guitar will continue to give great sounds as you advance!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "great starter that grows with you", "unixReviewTime": 1311379200, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2011"}

However, there are some issues with this case as well as limitations.First the issues: while the covering appears to be stitched on, it is - for the most part - glued on, and if the case is left in a hot, unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges. On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods. However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass.The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic. The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides. This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs, but if you have a heavy road schedule, and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band's gear, this case will not afford you the protection of an ATA-style case.Also note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass, so any long-scale J- or P-style basses will fit. I cannot be sure about other brands and models.I mentioned an ATA-style case as a better solution, and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules.

However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound.  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed.  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening.  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound. Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound.  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a \"must have\" accessory.

Beach \"KRB\"", "helpful": [23, 26], "reviewText": "ORIGINAL POSTING:My first Mini, purchased over a decade ago, was a bad investment. The four neck bolts continually came loose, no amount of tweaking could get the intonation right (Note: adults should probably play the Mini-Strat \"tuned- up\"...I play mine at F - Bb - Eb - G# - C - F...or, if they have large fingers, they should probably use a capo with standard tuning and heavier strings) so the string tension is similar to their full-sized guitars), the pick-up pole pieces didn't align with the strings, and the finish was uneven. It cost $99 and I figured I got less than what I paid for. It was clearly a toy and I sold it for $25 without regret.Three or four years ago I extensively played a \"Hello Kitty\" Mini owned by a friend. It cost her $149 and, after I tweaked the intonation and the string height a bit, it was a playable instrument. I figured she pretty much got what she paid for. A decent little 3/4-sized traveler.Recently, after reading that Fender had upped the build quality of their oriental Squier guitars, I again purchased a Mini. I couldn't be more pleased. Right out of the box, everything about the instrument was spot-on. The construction was rock solid, the neck was straight, the strings were correctly positioned, the intonation was exact, and the finish was flawless. It was, in two words, masterfully made. I figure I got at least $249 worth of guitar for $99. How cool is that?The sound of the current Mini is \"classic Fender single-coil\"...shimmering with bell-like overtones. The pickups are functional, if a bit thin sounding compared to the Seymour Duncans I have on my full-size Strat. The six-in-line enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping. The neck is perfectly finished and fast. Because it's a 3/4-sized guitar, the first and second-fret string spacing might be too tight for adult players with large fingers. But for everyone else, including fortunate children, the current Mini is a sweet ride. And at its present \"give away\" street value, this has to be one of the most fantastic bargains in the musical kingdom! Bravo Fender!June, 2014 UPDATE:The mini has become my preferred, go-to electric. I now have one for jazz with a single Lace Hot Gold in the middle position with a custom pick guard from Chandler Music's Pickguard Heaven (see attached photo) and a very versatile one with a Lace Red, Silver, and Blue pickup set. Why? For the same reason John Lennon once owned a 3/4-sized guitar, I suppose. Obscure chords and finger patterns are easier on the hands because fingers have to span less distance. I believe the slight tonal inaccuracy of the 3/4 scale is offset by increased finger-placement accuracy.

She's joined the jazz band at her school and since she is smaller than the average 12 year old, she needed a smaller sized guitar.  It was packaged very well and it took a while just to get the guitar out of the packaging.  The only thing I have found so far that sort of disappointed me was that there were some dark stain blemishes on the white pick guard. Trying to get the stains off with a damp paper towel didn't work so I took a special soft, damp sponge made to remove stains and gently rubbed it over the spots.  They came off but the finish on the plastic pick guard is dulled where I had rubbed the stains off.  That sort of irked me.  However, it didn't seem to bother my daughter nearly as much as it did me.Despite the blemish episode, it fits her perfectly.  I tried to tune it using a clamp-on Snark tuner.  That didn't work at all for some reason so we went to Guitar Center and bought an electric guitar tuner which you plug the cord into from the guitar.  That really worked well to tune the guitar.  The tuning pegs (gears) were stiff and a bit hard to turn.  When I change the strings I will adjust them to make them easier to turn.  The strings the guitar comes with are very cheap so I'll need to change those out soon for a much better set, but they'll have to do for now.I plugged the guitar to my old Crate amp and it sounded pretty good.  The knobs on the front of the guitar turn well an did what they are supposed to do.  It's easy to control the tone and volume from the guitar without having to dicker much with the amp.  My daughter had a great time getting used to it.  She's a great classical guitarist (I teach classical guitar) so playing an electric guitar was a new experience for her.  My old Strat is just too big and heavy for her and this black one looks good (despite the dullness that only I can see) on her and she was awesome playing jazz guitar in her school concert the other night.  Since this guitar is so inexpensive and is just right for a smaller person, I really can't find anything major wrong to say about it.  I'm glad I bought it, just wish it didn't come with the stains.  It feels solid, well-constructed, and not very heavy.  I like playing it too!I've ordered a really good gig bag, new cord, a Pignose amp just for her and of course, a bunch of new electric guitar strings.

For $100 it's an OK starter guitar for a kid (and I guess really short people who can't play a regular Fender), but not something I'd recommend to anyone else.  And my kid thinks it looks cool, so he'll be more likely to stick with it.Even though it has a laminated body, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood.  The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them, and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed.  It's light and easy to handle.  The hardware isn't bad, with a stable bridge (good idea not to put a floating trem in this), 5-way blade switch, solid jack and strap anchors, and smooth knobs.  The pickups are not top notch but work well enough (a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does, so I'm not complaining).  It has a nice red paint job.On the down side, besides some sharp fret ends, it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be.  The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret.  The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side, so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings.  It has one small pit in the red finish.  It has no paperwork or owner's manual.  The tuners are kind of choppy.  And the body/neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune.It comes strung with Fender 9's, which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down, so it's good for a kid just starting out.  I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound.

There are better guitars out there, but not for $170. This really is a great deal.2. How does it sound?Fantastic. It's definitely \"bright\", which a few of the other reviews pointed out, but it also has new strings on it, so it might be a little too early to judge. That said, it's got a nice full sound and if you play up closer to the neck you get more bass in the mix.3. How's the action?Just right. Low enough that it's easy to play (for a 12 string) but no buzzing strings.4. How about the neck?Wider than a 6 string, but not much. Probably a centimeter or so wider. I have small hands and had no problem playing it. The main thing is the added pressure it takes to push down twice as many strings as normal.5. How does it play?Great.6. How does it look?Great. Nice natural finish, all shiny and new. What's not to love? (Note: the picture shows a more whitish finish, but it's a normal natural finish like you'd see on most acoustic guitars.

It tuned up with no problems, even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string, and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out. You constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure. The bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge!I found that when tuning, you should up stroke the small strings so that you don't hit the large one right next to it.I have no fret buzz, finger rash, or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar, and the strings sit low which I like.The nut is a bit sharp on the edges, but a file or sanding will take care of that.The strings are not that bad, and will do until the first change out.I have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar, from terrible to fantastic, but the one I have is the later.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love it.

As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home, I've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years.  There's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust, yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension, preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward.  But the \"rub\" is their non-adaptability.  The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music.  Consequently, these ubiquitous, well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan, especially with a couple of keyboards, amps, instrument stands, and other requisite gear on board.This is where Amazon's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive (of course, it doesn't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset).  It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music.  Consequently, it's much easier to find a convenient place--whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat--for packing the stand.  Simply \"slide\" it into position.The drawback--apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about (be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws!)--is that this thing is heavy.  Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you've owned or been around the latter, the first thing you're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable, substantial addition in weight. At the same time, with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, serrated wheels), the On-Stage stand doesn't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset--in other words, I'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long, exhausting 4-hour gig.Bottom line: the On-Stage appears to be a good value--a truly heavy-duty stand (in most respects) that'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs.  But don't expect it to lighten your load or, simply because it's heavier, to last longer than a Manhasset.If you do a lot of traveling and don't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand, there's at least one truly lightweight (albeit plastic) stand that's worked out really well for me (perhaps needless to say, some haven't--they fall apart or they're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving, pint-sized cases).  But the Peak stand is made to hold up (in turn, it holds up relatively heavy music books) and has served me well for several years (just as I was about to condemn the stand, I called the company, they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped, and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since).  It'll cost you a bit more, but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A trade-off, but possibly a better traveling companion.", "unixReviewTime": 1294185600, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2011"}

They are perfect for somebody that plays gigs and changes strings frequently. For the more casual player, these might not be the best choice.For the gigging musician, there is nothing better than these D'Addario strings. They are light weight, have great sound, and are inexpensive. These might take a very slight nod over Ernie Ball strings.For the more casual musician, somebody that isn't changing their strings once a week, these are probably not a great choice. Personally, I use Elixir strings on my electric guitars, a Les Paul 2008 Standard and a 1982 Gibson Lucille. I do not play gigs, so a set of strings doesn't see an hour or two of really hard playing per night. The coating on Elixir's helps keep corrosion down and is easier on my fingers; I like their feel a bit better than these strings. I get about a month of playing from those strings. Sadly, these D'Addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing.I've tried a variety of strings, Ernie Ball, Elixir, and D'Addario, on my guitars and the way I play, the Elixir's just sound and play the best to me. Of course, your mileage may vary. If I did start to play gigs, I would probably switch to a more affordable string like these.A silly cosmetic thing, I hate the packaging of these strings. D'Addario makes a huge deal out of reduced packaging and being environmentally responsible with their products. The strings come in a cardstock outer box, with a single plastic package inside. Each string size has a different colored ball on the end to help a person figure out the string gauge. I change strings myself, and I really prefer the individual paper envelopes for the strings, with the gauge clearly printed on the package. If you are new to changing strings, or only change them infrequently, this all in one package will confuse the heck out of you. Especially at first, I preferred to work with one string at a time.D'Addario also makes a major deal out of the serial number on their package to help fight fake strings. Their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the package of stings is authentic. I kind of disliked the fact that you have to enter an email address to even get started. They could have very simply left a spot to enter the serial number with no other information necessary.In the end, the silly colored balls at the end of the strings, well they look goofy on my guitars. I wouldn't mind the colors on an acoustic (the ball gets hidden by the peg anyway), but those balls are visible on my electric guitar. I just prefer the simple gold balls on the ends of other strings.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good For Gigging Musicians", "unixReviewTime": 1330560000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2012"}

I like my action medium-low, comfortable for straight playing and bending, solid intonation for chords, yet not too much fret rattle for slide.I usually stretch the heck out of Ernie Ball's after putting them on because they have so much spring in them. I deliberately left the D'Addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all. Their new sound is quite bright as advertised, but has far less of what I call `new string jangle', which is fine by me. As a kid, I'd sweat that off in an hour but these days, playing a number of instruments, it can last awhile.There's a string tension chart, handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number.  I'll admit I'd never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting, but apparently that's the case and D'Addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set. If you do come across fakes, if you're willing to report it, they'll provide you with a genuine replacement for free.I've used D'Addario phosphor-bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over 25 years and swear by their quality and consistency. I've used Ernie Ball's on electrics for even longer.

The strings were easy to work with on installation.In particular, I liked the color coding of the strings vs the traditional individuallywrapped strings. The color coding makes it hard to accidentally mix similar strings and ismore environmentally friendly in terms of packaging. Also, the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer.The strings tuned up quickly and reached stable tuning within a very short time frame.After only about an hour they needed only slight tuning adjustment and were ready to go.First, I tried the Hybrid using a clean acoustic setting and the string produced a surprisingly nice range of sound, especially in the lower registers. This was a bit unexpected because of the \"bright\" label on the package. I actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus. The highs were clean and bright.Using the Bernard Butler setting on the Line 6 Amp I tried the electric side of the Hybrid.The action of the strings was light and fast and notes could be comfortably bent. The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar, which leads me to my closing point.Overall, I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around $3,  D'Addario EXL110's will be put in my \"Best Buy\" category for future purchases.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great value strings for electric and hybrid guitars", "unixReviewTime": 1332201600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2012"}

I've tried 10-52 but the top is a little too floppy for D and that makes notes sound out of tune if you don't press the string just right. Also tried 11-56 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone, the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string. That reduces articulation. So while you get a fuller sound with the 56, you get more dynamics and attack with the 52, and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier. You can EQ fullness into a rhythm track, but you can't add in pick attack and greater dynamics.Tension wise, at D standard 11-56 is ideal but 11-52 is doable. Sound wise, 11-52 has been best for my metal recordings and that's why I'm sticking with the EXL116 set from now on. I also replaced the G string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords.

One reviewer says it's made by Fender. I seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on. Show me proof. Someone else seems to think it's made by Epiphone. Sorry to disappoint you but Epiphone doesn't make cases. They accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost. I have several Epiphone 335 Dots and a Gibson ES335. I bought Epiphone cases for all of them. I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case. I couldn't see any sense in paying more money just for the Gibson name. My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case. Although the cases have the Epiphone logo on the outside, they are all made by TKL. How do I know that you're wondering? They have a TKL tag on the inside of the accessory compartment. That's been a few years ago. The cases you get now could be made by a different company. The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar. Regardless of who actually makes the case, it has to meet Epiphone's manufacturing standards so it's got to be good. This case will fit The 335 Dot, Casino, Sheraton and the Gibson ES335. Anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II has a much thicker body than the 335 Dot. This case was not intended for the Emperor II. It's a great case and will protect your guitar, but it's not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car.

Well built and functional, just the perfect size for your Dot,  Casino, 335 , or in my case a Sheraton II.  Finished in faux leather, a nice scuff resistant vinyl of some sort, much like the old Fender Tolex.  NICE hardware on this case. All the latches are fitted well and are both good looking and rock solid. Hinges too.  The handle isn't going anywhere!  Inside you get a nice soft plush interior, the obligatory hinged compartment for strings and things, and a good solid rattle free fit for your guitar.Top all that off with 2 feet on the end for standing upright,  2 well placed feet on the side and 3 on the bottom. NO matter which way you place the case (other than upside down) both your guitar and case are protected.  You get a total of FIVE good quality latches (one of them locks, key included) and hinges at either end. As I said, the hardware on the case is really good.  For under one hundred dollars this case is an unbelievable bargain.I was immediately struck by how SOLID this case feels.  It is no lightweight either.  I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open, etc.  Mine came almost scuff free out of the box, but there were a few signs that it had been handled a bit before packing. Still, it looks super and the overall visual presentation far outstrips the price.If I could make just two criticisms, it would be that I notice the stitching appears to be single stitched, rather than double stitched. Also, the strip of fabric that holds the lid open seems overly thin and not well implemented. It is a smallish piece of colored vinyl attached to the lid and case body and it looks like this will be the first thing to wear out or even just up and break.  Also, when you close the case , instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case, necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing.  I would have much preferred a nice self folding piece covered with the same material that lines the case itself.  This is just a minor niggle and could easily be replaced by either yourself if you are handy, or most any music store with a halfway decent tech in the backroom.I have no reason to believe this case will fall apart anytime soon .

No matter which pre you get make sure it can supply phantom power because this mic needs it.Also, this model is XLR only. Even if you get an XLR to TRS adapter you will not be able to provide phantom power to it with that arrangement, so make sure that your mixer has a spare XLR input for this mic, and that it will provide phantom power if you skip my recommendation to get a pre amp.There are a few other things you need to know or consider if this is your first condenser mic: use the included shock mount because this mic picks up handling noise. Merely touching it will show up as ambient noise in your mix. A pop filter is essential.This mic is not optimal for live performances because it's delicate and does not lend itself to excess handling. It is perfect in controlled, stationary environments like home studios. Another reason is itd will pick up a lot of nearby stage noise if not placed in a 'sweet spot'.I mentioned that this is perfect for vocals and it is. However, it is not the best solution for micing instruments or amps, especially those in the lower registers. One of the main reasons for this is the low end frequency response is starts at 30Hz. You would be better off with a mic that goes down to 20Hz for instruments and amps.Bottom line: this is a great entry level condenser mic, especially for folks on a budget.

They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L (A, D, and G) but add some strings from the medium size: low E (.055 replacing .053) and high E and B each increasing .001, from .012 to .013, and .016 to .017.I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position - no problem.The improvement in tone is in all the right places. Very nice. Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total, from the 162.2 lbs. for the D'Addario light.I play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all strings.I suppose things are always subject to change, but for now, I am amazed and delighted with these strings.

Since they swivel, my Fender necks are just as secure as my Gibson necks. The depth is adjustable, so they will account for the difference between acoustic guitars and solid body electrics. While I never had a problem with the rubber grip on the hangers marring the finish of my Nitro coated guitars, I didn't want to take a chance, so I use self-adhesive sheets of felt and wrap the posts with felt to further protect the guitar's finish. I try and screw them into studs to support the weight, and where I can't do it, I hang some of my lighter guitars, but the anchors that come with the hangers are strong and secure... although I sprung a couple bucks and bought similar screw-in anchors; but made out of metal - just that added bit of security to make sure nothing happens.

The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wall.If you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures, so I will have to do new pictures, but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.The easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theBlack & Decker BDL100AV All-In-One SureGrip Laser Leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.As far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.I DO NOT, however, recommend buying theString Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.EDIT: I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes.  The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  Just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.

Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it.I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too, only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar.Oh, I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in, but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.

It holds some 4 or maybe 5 picks while the 5005 holds around 7 (if you use 0.60. gauge picks or lower). I did the test just for the heck of it with several picks. Since I use the Planet Waves Chrome Dome stainless steel picks (Joe Satriani), I only need to keep a couple on the holder plus the one I am playing with, so for me it does the job perfectly. I have a nice 2013 Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 with a beautiful and very stylish carved maple top, so I needed the pickholder to look better to better match to it. The adhesive works perfect and will not damage your guitar's top if placed as instructed. Place it gently, no need to press it too hard.

I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "was good while it worked", "unixReviewTime": 1378166400, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2013"}

The remainder of this review is going to compare this cable to the Monster model.I'll give the Monster cable a plus for outer jacket and overall construction, but where it matters - signal transmission - I frankly cannot tell the two apart. Part of the reason may be that this cable uses both foil and braided shielding to minimize handling and emissions noise. And I am sure that the oxygen-free copper conductor also has something to do with it. Both the every expensive Monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction.I love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the Monster. It does a better job of holding flex to a minimum, although the connectors on the Monster are a better quality.Bottom line: the Monster cable wins out in few places, but this one is no slouch or cheaply made piece of junk. In fact, I will probably keep the Monster cables in my home studio and switch completely to this model for gigging. For one thing, there is no discernible degradation in sound quality with this one, and for another this costs a fifth of what I paid for the Monster.

(I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness). The only problems I had with \"regular\" picks was: (1) them slipping in my hand (turning around), (2) out of my hand (on the floor), and, of course, (3) breaking. I decided to give the Dava picks a try. I bought a pack of the \"jazz\" picks and a pack of these \"grip tips\". I really thought I'd like the jazz picks better: that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick. But, after trying them both, I find these (the grip trips) are now my \"pick of choice\". They fit my grip perfectly, stay put in my hand, and give me maximum control when I play, whether it's lead or rhythm. I have yet to break one. I'm mainly buying another set because I've given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available. I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations, so whenever I pick up a guitar to play, I've got one close by (also always keep a spare in my wallet). Bottom line is, for me at least, these picks are tops! Sure I can still use a regular pick when that's all that's available. But why not use the best when I can???Update: Been using these picks for a year since my first review. Still love them. Still have yet to break one (and I can be an aggressive strummer).

Depends on how you like it or not whether you like that metallic ting - I do for certain passages.The pick's construction seems to be fairly rigid & yet it has potential to do more than merely chug again on the low E & A strings.

At present, I own an MXR Phase 90, a Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter, and a Line 6 MM4 Modulations Modeler (with a few phaser patches), so I can compare these three units.The Phase 90 has a single \"Speed\" control that sets the rate of the phase, so it is simple to use. If there is a single knob, that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit. In this case, I agree.The MXR Phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units. In my opinion, it also gives the best sound within its capabilities, and actually seems to boost the volume slightly. The Boss PH-3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable, and the Line 6 MM4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because I usually don't leave modulations on for an entire song, but turn them on/off in different sections (unless its a chorus).Of the three, the Phase 90 has the least versatility. You can imitate the Phase 90 sound on both of the other units (the Line 6 MM4 does a slightly better job) and both the PH-3 and MM4 have more sonic possibilities. Also, the Boss PH-3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the Phase 90 which stays in a \"normal\" range.

This one fills the bill pretty well. Build quality is quite good (made in Indonesia, not China as I had expected), and the intonation is perfect. The finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well. A pick guard is present, but when I removed the plastic shipping protector, the entire guard came up with it. The adhesive residue comes right off, so I will play the guitar without a pickguard. Bracing is light -- the entire guitar is light. The body is a bit larger in the lower bout than I expected, but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnought.I take issue with some reviewers' suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box. The string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck, cramping the fingers. The nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more. The action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully, and just a little at a time. This work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier, but if you can do it yourself, will improve the playability of the instrument.The strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap, so I replaced them with a set of D'Addario EJ-16 Light Phosphor-Bronze.

It's not my old Takamine, but the negative differences are slight, and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitar.The first is that the finish is not as good. The sanding between coats was skimped, which means that the finish on the front has some texture; the sides of the guitar are also a bit rough.The second probably flows from the first.  The tone is a touch wooden; it doesn't sing as the old Taka did.Positives: the intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and enjoyable to play) with a slide. After the first tune-up of the strings, it stayed in tune.For its price, this guitar is a superb introduction to playing.A very young child, or a small woman, will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort.

No. But for less than $100, nice doesn't even describe it.My Jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing.  The outside box had a little damage, but the guitar was well protected inside, so no problem.Since I'd read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish, one of the first things I did was check it out thoroughly. Nope, no flaws noticeable to me.  Kind of a satin \"laid back\" finish that feels good and looks nice.  Oh, but I did immediately remove the pick guard.  It just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and (in my opinion) it looks better without it.Other reviews had complained about a too-low action. But mine seems dead on.  Of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule. But even so, there's really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low.Some mentioned rusty strings.  Not on mine. The strings looked fine, and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well.And of course the guitar sounds good.  Again, maybe not $750 good, but at least $250-300 good.

I tried this untreated 'MicrofiberPolish Cloth' on my Gibson ES-339 because I had heard good things about it.We'll begin with some stats: the cloth is 11-3/4\" by 11-3/4\" and has an 1/8\" border stitched aroundthe edge. It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea. There is a small warning on theback of the package that states: \"Not designed for cleaning electrical devices.\" You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry. Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny. I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body's front and back and BACKof the neck. I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off. When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish.What I discovered about this cloth, even with increased elbow grease, is that it has it's limitations.So, if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out. If the body oils have been there for awhile, probably collecting dust, then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument. Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument. Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument. You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it.I decided to use Dunlop's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges. I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely. Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'. It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid. I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind.You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish.The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play. I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated  on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar.So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything. I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean  and polished with minimal effort. My highexpectations, based upon the blurb, were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around. It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess.Nonetheless, I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime.

This will probably help protect your finish over the long run too.You may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag. This thing rocks!

I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page. It really isn't fair to the actual good product to have it's rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM. It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want. When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD micro-fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint, it makes me sad. I have had both of the other items, and this micro-fiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2. This item has sewn/seamed edges that will not fray. It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints & smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind. No scratches, no lint, no hint it was ever there. My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth, and I use the thing almost every day.I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it. I told him I would just get another. Then I came here and couldn't remember which version I bought, and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item (leaves behind lint?? What the crap are they talking about?)...turns out they are talking about a completely different item. I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Micro-fiber, then I placed an order for 2 more (1 for me, 1 to give away, again).Putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course. Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page (literally) and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed. At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones, you know what version to buy and which to avoid.Anyway, /End rant.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This Is Awesome!

It felt way too bulky under foot and went from about 0 to about 3 when barely applying volume. This is unacceptable when you're trying to clean up your distortion channel or trying to accomplish a slow volume swell. But as soon as I laid the Ernie Ball down and plugged it in I fell in love. Not only does it feel great under your foot and provide precise control, it has a complete volume sweep. Add in some delay and it will give you an organ-type swell. Absolutely perfect!I've heard some people complain about the Ernie Ball Jr being a flimsy pedal but I just don't see this.

The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.

(Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?

This makes it very comfortable.I might change all my guitar straps from 2\" to 3\" now that I've had a taste of comfort.If you aren't comfortable playing, than you are distracted which removes you from the creative moment.

After a Dunlop lock failure, I decided to change over.  Our band's drummer and guitarist both used and recommened these straps so I gave them a chance.  They are amazing, much more comfortable then one of those bulky, heavy leather straps and just as strong.  I was worried that the plastic clips wouldn't hold up, but they do.  I feel 100% secure that my guitar will not fall.  They look good as well and they are easily adjustable.  My transmitter pack slid on with ease and I was ready to go.  A lot of bands I have seen on the road use these straps.I didn't rate these straps 5 stars however, because of a few reasons:1- I play heavy guitars, I was concerned about the screws that came with the straps.  For a standard, lightweight guitar they may be fine, but for say a Gibson, or my Agile Intrepid Pro, I wanted more security.  I took a slighty wider and longer screw than provided, covered it and filled the install hole with epoxy, and drilled it in.  It holds incredible, its NOT coming out now for sure.2- I use the black, white, and blue colors.  They discolor very easily.  Through sweat, dirt, and cigarette smoke, they eventually start to look nasty.  I would suggest going with the black for this reason.3- I put my confidence in these straps 100%, but I wouldn't start doing guitar swings with them.  Its just a plastic clip, and anything can fail.  I've seen guys electrical/duct tape the clips for extra support and they've all been able to get away with swinging their guitars around, but personally I choose to play it safe (as I lost my best guitar to a failed straplock during a spin).All DiMarzio products are incredible.

The price is unbelievable, it's nice to have three sets in a box and these are the best acoustic strings on the market.  That's only my opinion and everyone has one......so many will disagree.I have an regular acoustic and an acoustic electric and strung both with these strings.  It made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar.  I find that most inexpensive guitars have cheap strings, most can be vastly improved with something as simple as new strings.  I really believe in these strings.  When I find a good thing, I am hooked and I will not use anything BUT these on anything acoustic.  On a guitar, strings are everything.  The tone feel and bend is what's important.  These are very light and VERY easy on the fingers, unlike clunky stock strings on most acoustics.  I guess they think you need big, think strings to produce volume....not so.  Some will disagree saying they break if they're too thin.  I would rather have a shorter life with strings, getting a pure beautiful, rich sound than have a long lasting flat string.  My thick stock strings were killing my fingers.  These are effortless to play and sound so sweet and mellow, just like an acoustic should sound.Again, someone will chime in and bash me for saying this...but I would put my inexpensive Yamaha up against guitars costing 10 times what I paid.  I have no plans of changing brands now I've made the string switch.  Some say thin strings break easily, but you should change strings often anyway.  I can do a string change-over in about 15 minutes on a bad day.  It's worth the effort.  I don't plan on hammering my acoustic anyway.  That's what the Fender is for.  AND it's not that I'm cheap either.  I own 18 guitars, 16 of which are electrics.  3 Gibson Les Paul's, 2 Fender Strats (one American) a couple of Dillions (another great find) and some other nice guitars.My Acoustic is just an inexpensive Yamaha 700 but is a very nice guitar for the money.

Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.I use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.Then I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing, - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.Try to practice for about an hour daily.

I've seen dozens of guitars come and go until I found my 1948 Gibson J-45 and I've tried dozens of types of strings.  Some guitars sound best with Phosphor Bronze.  Some sound best with 80/20s.  I still have an all Koa Martin guitar that is *so* bright that it sounds best with the normally tone-killing Elixir Polywebs. Got a guitar-banjo? Try silk-and-steel or silk-and-phosphor. Trust me.  I've been through my John Pearse phase. Pyramids?  Yep. Tried 'em.  I really liked LaBellas.  The problem was that back when I was using them, they would tarnish in the packaging.  I don't know if that's still the case.Anyway, the bottom line is that D'Addario phosphor bronze are my go to string.  They set the baseline for every guitar I've ever owned.  (Note: That's baseline. In some cases, I've decided something else sounded better.)  For many guitars, including my J-45, there's nothing I've found that I've liked better.Also worth noting:  The string that sounds best depends not only on the particular guitar, but also on the type of pick one uses, the type of music one plays, and the way one approaches the instrument.  The string that's best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be what's best for delicate finger style.Bottom line: Don't follow leaders.  Watch the parkin' meters.  Experiment.

Put a crimp or bend in each string about 3/4 of an inch or so from the ball at the end, about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string, fairly sharp. Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on. Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar, out of the way of the pin. Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin! The pin should fit tightly into the hole, and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin, not below it. Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin. After pushing in the pin, you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut, and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole, keeping it tight. It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar, but I can't see in there to verify this is so, but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin!

One of those duh things I didn't even think of until just now).Based on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon, I purchased this triple-set of strings.  Instant gratification.  First, they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis (no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days, but these retained tune fairly well).  The sound is excellent, the playability comfy.  The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations:* First, three sets for $13 (currently).  Cannot beat the value for price.* BRILLIANCE.  What many people call &#34;bright&#34;, brilliance is the opposite of &#34;dull&#34;.  Some strings sound dull right out of the package.  These strings are brilliant, bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar.* TONE.  The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through, no hint of &#34;tinniness&#34;, &#34;plunk&#34; or &#34;twang&#34;.* MELLOW.  Mellow is difficult to define, but the best definition I've heard is, &#34;Ah, that sounds nice.&#34;  Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar.  It's a pleasantness that doesn't grate on your ears when you pluck a string.  These strings are medium-mellow, just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep.  : )* BALANCE.  At first the E overtoned the b and e.  But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out.  The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass.* COMFORT.  The 12-53mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers.  Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars.  Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action.  These strings are just right-- especially the 53mm E, which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY:  These are excellent strings, which doesn't surprise me since I've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years.  Martin and GHS are both good strings, but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try.

Beneke", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "First of all, let me say, from some of the pictures I have seen posted of this Pop Filter, when put on a Yeti mic stand, the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured. This is a design flaw, not with the Pop Filter, but with the Yeti stand, as this filter has been around long before the Yeti came out. Blue, or a clever do it yourself person, could easily fix it, by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount. Then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand. There are many great pictures of other clever fixes, as well.  Since I have mine hanging upside down, on a boom stand attached to a Blue Radius Shock mount, this is not an issue for me, but I will say it is a problem Blue should fix. (I have written an addendum on the bottom, for a great fix.) Other brands of filters will give the same, if not more problems. I am not going to knock any stars off, because I'm reviewing the filter itself, which is superb and how it works for me.Now for the meat. This is a studio grade, high quality product, all metal, except for the two tightening knobs. The dual screen design eliminates any plosives, P's and B's for example, better than any screen I have used so far. This is especially true when, the screen distance is about an inch from the Yeti capsule screen, and you are 4 to 6 inches away from the unit itself, which I have found to be the Yeti's sweet spot in the Cardioid pattern. Next the silk screened Blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot, if you place it in front of the capsule area. I like the idea of a metal screen, especially if you are transporting it, you won't have to worry about snagging,or runs, as you do with the cloth filters. Speaking of old cloth filters, I have a Neumann, which is about 12 years old, a very nice screen as well, but it does not cut the pops as well as the Blue, especially if you get closer to the mic and screen. Also when reading copy, or maybe music, I can see over and through the Blue filter, much better than the round 6 & 1/4 inch jobs Like the Neumann. You can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily, cheaper filters I have used in the past, will creep back into unwanted positions, the Blue behaves. The Blue Pop is absolutely transparent, no muffling, as with foam filters, The curved design of the Blue Filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all. The screen is a solid build, as are all of the Blue products I have used so far. It also fits the look of the Yeti and Radius Shock Mount like a glove. Surprisingly, I paid a little over $30.00 on Amazon, a real bargain in my mind, for such high quality. This filter is for all the Blue Microphones by the way, and I am going to use it on my entire collection of mics!10/7/11 AddendumIf you need to use the Yeti as a table top mic, especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter (any brand), I would suggest buying aSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand, which works great for this set up!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yet(i) Another Great Product From Blue", "unixReviewTime": 1317340800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2011"}

The mandolin is NOT playable in its brand new state (not in tune, action too high, lower action will result in string buzzes). And this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup.

So this is more than adequate for daily practice. Often times, it even stay in tune the next days. I may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one. The finish on this model has some blemish (some small black spots on top the sunburst color), but only if you look really close, I would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred, at less than 40$, no problem at all.Of course, this mandolin is no match for more expensive models/brands (such as Kentucky) but I gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance / cost ratio.If you don't know how to setup mandolin, then be prepared to pay 60$ to 80$ for a professional setup (which is a must, otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune). Some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge (that's unfair).

Do they sound as good as a 5K Gibson F5? Not hardly. Do they sound good for a 40-50 dollar Chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find? Actually, yeah, they do. This is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so I wouldn't worry about that. When you get it, the action is likely to be high and if you can't lower the bridge enough with the wheels it's easy enough to sand some off the bottom. Also, like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash. Just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something. Decent strings don't cost very much.Depending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built, you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable (after you fix the bridge and strings...) little instrument. The hardware isn't the best and the tuners suck but hey, if you're just starting out, tuning is part of the game.For $49.99 (and I've seen new ones 10 bucks less from time to time) it's worth the investment. You can spend more on dinner and a movie, and after you ate and watched the flick, it's gone. With the money spent here, you'll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening. My 7 year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it, so far, so good. It's been holding up well.BTW, if $49.99 breaks you, and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin (been there), since you're here reading this, that means you're on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going, after that, you can find MANY good books/cds/dvds that will help you along even further and one day you'll get a better instrument. I'm actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so I don't take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever, and if I get cold and run out of wood, these are almost cheap enough to burn.One thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these. If you go to certain online classifieds (CL coughcoughcough) you'll notice people ask 50 bucks or MORE for these, sometimes over 100. USED. Same with pawnshops, and those people know what these cost new. This is one of the few cases where I'd buy new over used. If you decide to sell it and as long as it's not in pieces it'll still bring 20-30 bucks used so you won't be out much, but really, it's a good servicable instrument with a little work, but if you're lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it. Again though, not that big a deal to fix if it's not.Oh, as stated elsewhere these don't have trussrods. That's not bad in itself. You'd be surprised how many mandolins didn't have them years ago and alot of them are still around. Even from some big makers. If the neck warps in a year or two, no big deal, you got your moneys worth.

They rock, roll, andbend with the greatest of ease; once broken in, of course. If you want a mellower, bluesier stringwith decent sustain try DR Pure Blues.I decided to use 9's on my Fender Tele hollow-body because the company puts 9s on their guitars.I didn't want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so I stuckwith the 9s. Hey, the Rev uses 7's; size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone.The other reason for the Pure Nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from P-90pick ups. Pure Nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit. One more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets; which is a good thing. Steel will wear down your frets a lot faster.I will say that my very first set of DR Pure Blues went bad after a few weeks. The windings brokeon the D-string at two places where the string fretted. The reason I kept going back to DR Bluesis that I have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars (4 solid bodies & another hollow-body) since then. Giving DR a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in 2010 was a fluke.If you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with DR Pure Blues.Allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone. This is because prior to the mid-40'smost strings were made of nickel. During WWII nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings. Or so the historical theory goes.Gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound. To achieve the \"vintage\" tone I am sure you would alsoneed the right amp AND the right touch to get to that point. I am not necessarily looking for a\"vintage\" tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last. Your exact mileagemay differ.I have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers. The only time I get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board. There is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much I wipethe fret board. Definitely not the strings though.

The tone seems slightly brighter, however, I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings. Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective \"sounds good\".These pins are a little thin (small) so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing. If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins. This may not be necessary, however, even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole. The string should go all the way through the hole, into the body of the guitar. Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches, if possible it should be listing toward the neck. Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly. Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this. Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin. Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin. The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own. Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole. If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you're trying to get your guitar in tune (typically ruining a brand new string in the process). If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body (correctly) or hanging on the pin (incorrectly). Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation.These fit my guitar snugly but not tightly, however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more (sometimes using two fingers' strength to bend that far).

It's easy to put on and take off, and it does its job. It mutes the violin to a reasonable level.  I used an SPL meter at a distance where a sustained open G string gave a reading of about +2db. With the mute, it dropped to -6db. I then tried a Yamaha silent electric violin (unplugged) and from the same distance, it barely registered. I recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about 1db, and the Yamaha read about -6db at that distance and setting.So it won't make your instrument completely silent, and from a purely subjective perspective, it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin, perhaps seeming about 10 to 20% louder had I not measured it.With accessories, tonal quality is typically important. But with a mute, you expect it to deteriorate. Surprisingly, there was still a lot of tone left, especially compared to the unplugged electric, yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced.You can't expect this to give great sound or complete silence, but it won't disturb the neighbors or their dogs, and it won't make the instrument sound dead.

All in all, it's a pretty nice device, expecially for the price.  Seems solid and well-made.  It has a nice big pedal for big feet.  It works smoothly.  I have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal.  My only gripe, is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal 9V battery, or a 12V plug in power supply.  Why the difference?  The really bad part (for me) is that I bought this to install in a newly-purchased Behringer pedal board, which comes with a 9V power supply.  So, in order for me to use this pedal in the board, I will have to run two different power supplies, or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard's power supply.

Bottom line:  the pedal itself is great, but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you.One final note about Behringer...they seem to get bad marks now and then.  I really don't understand why.  I have two Behringer amps, two of their stomp boxes, the above-mentioned pedal board, and the volume pedal just discussed.  I really like all of them.

I decided to see if I would have any issues if I used my One-Spot AC adapter on it - polarity corrected, of course.  It worked just fine.  I usually power my looper with the same adapter so I built a splitter cable with labeled, polarity specific terminations and everything worked fine.  My curiosity didn't end there though.  I wanted to know if there would be any discernible difference if I used a 12 volt power supply.  I did it and the only difference I could find was that the power indicator LED was just a wee bit dimmer using the 9 volt adapter.  There was no change in the sonics whatsoever, nor was there a reduction in output volume that I could hear.  So what's up with the 12 volt adapter spec, Behringer?

This is the same behavior that I have when connected to the RE-20, in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that's anything but gradual. It's not the end of the world, but I was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works Great With The Roland RE-20 Space Echo", "unixReviewTime": 1401235200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014"}

But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  You can pay more and get less.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Bargain Microphone or Just a Cosmetic Knockoff?", "unixReviewTime": 1316908800, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2011"}

I bought it myself as a kind of experiment. I'm learning blues harp. I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing. For this reason, the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand. While my Astatic JT-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, I can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals.The spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands. The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand. And the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss).The mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies. Here are a couple of more casual notes:1. The mike in the picture looked bluish to me. What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish.2. The product description seems to report a weight of 8.5 ounces. I measured this mike at 10.3 ounces. That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that I've used.3. The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 Hz. Bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike.4. The mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its  only real deficiency. These switches really are very handy.5. In actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss.6. The mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection. I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.I hope this helps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A value mike for the Mississippi sax", "unixReviewTime": 1340409600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2012"}

They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use.
